The Storage parameter in the /etc/systemd/journald.conf file defines whether to store system journals in a volatile manner or persistently across reboot. 
Set this parameter to persistent, volatile, auto, or none as follows:

[Journal]
Storage=persistent/volatile/auto/none

persistent: stores journals in the /var/log/journal directory which persists across reboots.
volatile: stores journals in the volatile /run/log/journal directory.
This is the default action if the Storage parameter is not set.
auto: if the /var/log/journal directory exists, then systemd-journald uses persistent storage, otherwise it uses volatile storage.

If the /var/log/journal directory does not exist, the systemd-journald service creates it.
As the /run file system is temporary and exists only in the runtime memory, data stored in it, including system journals, do not persist across a reboot.

none: do not use any storage. All logs are dropped but log forwarding will still work as expected.
